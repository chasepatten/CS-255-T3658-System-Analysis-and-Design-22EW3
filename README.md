# CS-255-T3658-System-Analysis-and-Design-22EW3

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
  - The client for DriverPass was the DriverPass Company who wanted to create a system that will help customers take lessons, exams as well as study resources for the DMV and driving tests. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would revise my Class Diagram. I would improve it by adding more detail to the design by adding more detail in the functions and variables needed.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- It is very important to consider the needs of the user as if they're needs are not met they will never want to use the system. I intepreted the needs of the user by putting myself in their shoes as I slwoly walked myself through every function of the system from their point of view.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- I try to analyze it from the different users point of view. That way I can then take that experience and try to translate into design documents that can help outline all of the different functional and nonfunctional aspects of the system.
